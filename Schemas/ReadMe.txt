﻿Schema XSD files provide for search selection, metadata fields, download group types, etc.
Schema XML files provide for translation and presentation of XSD.

SchemaDescriptor URIs (schemas.getenvy.com) are universal names, and cannot easily be changed.
Schema reconciliation is in SchemaMappings.xml and Schema.cpp, etc.

The exact filename from .xsd is used to detect related resources: (.xml/.ico)
Library icons may be re-specified in xml. Optional naming variants:
".Skin.ico" icons allow upgrade-safe custom skinning.
".Safe.ico" icons are used for WinXP and fallback. (Was Win2K)
".Alt.ico"  icons are used for any prior styling. (Pre-Win10)

"Database" legacy folder was used for convenience in xml translation. (Outdated)
"typeFilter" extensions in xml are used for download group default filters.

Library Organizer file/folder inclusion itself remains hard-coded.
Filetype .ext handling is in core LibraryBuilderInternals.cpp, and various Library Builder Plugins.
Default folders are in LibraryFolder, AlbumFolder, etc.
Folders translated by Schema language when missing (at first run or deletion).

Note many aspects are mutually dependant in various places,
any functional change must often be mirrored elsewhere.  (xsd/xml/code)
